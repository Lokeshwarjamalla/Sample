To set up a Hyperledger Fabric test network, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Docker and Docker Compose
Node.js and npm
Go
Hyperledger Fabric binaries
Step 1: Install Hyperledger Fabric Samples, Binaries, and Docker Images
Clone the Hyperledger Fabric samples repository, which contains sample scripts, chaincode, and a preconfigured test network.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples.git
cd fabric-samples
Run the script to download the binaries and images.

bash
Copy code
curl -sSL https://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s
This will download the binaries, Docker images, and other dependencies for Hyperledger Fabric.

Step 2: Start the Test Network
Navigate to the test-network directory in the fabric-samples folder.

bash
Copy code
cd test-network
Start the network by running the following script, which will set up a Fabric network with two organizations:

bash
Copy code
./network.sh up
Create a channel (e.g., "mychannel") for the organizations to communicate.

bash
Copy code
./network.sh createChannel -c mychannel
Step 3: Deploy the Chaincode
You need a smart contract (chaincode) to define asset management operations such as creating, updating, and querying assets.

Deploy a sample chaincode (e.g., "basic") provided by Fabric or write your own.
bash
Copy code
./network.sh deployCC -ccn basic -ccp ../asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-go -ccl go
This deploys the "basic" chaincode to the channel.
Step 4: Interact with the Network
After deploying the chaincode, you can interact with the network using the Fabric CLI or through applications in Node.js, Java, or Go.

Use the CLI to test chaincode commands. For example, create an asset using:

bash
Copy code
peer chaincode invoke -o localhost:7050 --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com --tls --cafile "$ORDERER_CA" -C mychannel -n basic -c '{"Args":["CreateAsset","asset1","DEALERID1","MSISDN1","1234","1000","Active","500","Credit","Test Remark"]}'
Query assets by running:

bash
Copy code
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n basic -c '{"Args":["ReadAsset","asset1"]}'
This basic setup allows you to deploy and interact with assets on a Hyperledger Fabric network. You can customize the chaincode to support additional asset fields like TRANSAMOUNT, TRANSTYPE, and REMARKS.
